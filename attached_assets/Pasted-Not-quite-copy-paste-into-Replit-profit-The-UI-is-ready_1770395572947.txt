Not quite “copy → paste into Replit → profit.” The UI is ready to drop in as a prototype, but to make it functional inside VERICASE you still need a few real-world pieces wired up (and one bugfix in the Python side).

Here’s the honest readiness check based on what’s inside your DETECTIVE BOARD.zip.

What’s already “ready”

✅ Front-end prototype(s)
	•	investigation-board-v2.html is a solid interactive investigator-board mock.
	•	You can ship it to Replit today as either:
	•	a static page under /public and iframe it, or
	•	port it into your app UI.

✅ Backend building blocks (Python)

You’ve got the pipeline modules right in the zip:
	•	ocr_processor.py, tone_analyzer.py, chunk_processor.py, embedding_generator.py, qdrant_loader.py, qdrant_query.py, etc.
	•	docker-compose.yml for Qdrant
	•	config.yaml, logging utils, file handler, etc.

So the parts exist.

What’s missing / needs fixing before it “runs”

1) ❌ main.py won’t run as-is

main.py imports src.document_pipeline etc., but your zip has no src/ folder—the files are in the root. So you need one of these:
	•	Option A: Create a /src directory and move the Python files into it (and adjust imports), or
	•	Option B: Edit main.py imports to use the root modules (e.g., from document_pipeline import DocumentPipeline), and update the other imports accordingly.

Right now, it will crash on import.

2) ⚠️ Replit + OCR dependencies will hurt (Paddle + Torch)

Your requirements.txt includes:
	•	paddlepaddle, paddleocr
	•	torch
	•	sentence-transformers
These are heavy, and on Replit they can be slow, fail to install, or run out of memory—especially if you scale to “hundreds of files.”

What to do (practical):
	•	Keep the pipeline, but run it as a separate worker/service (even if it’s just another Replit repl), or
	•	Swap OCR to a lighter path for MVP (Tesseract) and keep PaddleOCR as “upgrade later,” or
	•	Treat OCR/embedding as “job queue → external worker” and keep Replit as the web app only.

3) ✅/⚠️ Qdrant needs an actual hosting plan

Your docker-compose.yml is great for local dev.
On Replit, Docker support is not always clean depending on workspace type. You’ll likely need:
	•	Qdrant hosted elsewhere (VM, managed, or separate service), OR
	•	a Replit deployment that can run it reliably.

4) ❌ No actual API bridge between board UI and case data yet

The HTML board is currently a prototype. To make it “see everything in the case,” you need:
	•	a VERICASE API endpoint like:
	•	GET /api/matters/:id/detective-board/model
	•	plus data models in your app DB:
	•	entities, relationships, evidence anchors, timeline events

Without that, it stays a pretty corkboard with mock data.

5) ⚠️ Security + permissions layer

If this can “see everything,” you must enforce:
	•	board membership / matter access
	•	role-based visibility (privilege/sensitive tags)
	•	audit logs for inferred relationships and scoring outputs

This isn’t optional if you want legal-grade.

Minimal “Ready for Replit” checklist (MVP)

If you do just these, it becomes functional (not perfect, but real):
	1.	Drop the UI into Replit

	•	Put investigation-board-v2.html in /public/detective-board.html
	•	Add a “Detective Board” tab that iframes it

	2.	Add one API endpoint returning real case data

	•	/api/matters/:matterId/detective-board/model
	•	Start with: people + documents + basic timeline + a few edges

	3.	Fix the Python entry point

	•	Make main.py import correctly (src vs root)

	4.	Stand up Qdrant

	•	Either external Qdrant or separate service you can reach

	5.	Wire ingestion

	•	When a file is added to a matter:
	•	OCR/extract → chunk → embed → push to Qdrant
	•	store anchors/citations in your DB

	6.	“Null vs Alternative” v1

	•	Add incident/baseline window selection
	•	Compute simple deltas:
	•	contact frequency change
	•	new entities introduced
	•	location/event anomalies (if you have that data)

That gets you to “functional.”

⸻

My blunt verdict
	•	UI prototype: ready ✅
	•	Pipeline code: close, but not runnable without import + infra fixes ⚠️
	•	Full integration (“see everything in the case”): needs API + DB graph layer ❌

So: it’s ready to go to Replit as a prototype + scaffold, but not ready as a fully integrated feature until you add the bridge + hosting decisions.

If you want, I can write a Replit plain-English “Implementation Sprint Plan” (3 phases: Prototype → Functional MVP → Production-ready) with exact tasks and acceptance checks, so you can hand it to your Replit builder without ambiguity.
