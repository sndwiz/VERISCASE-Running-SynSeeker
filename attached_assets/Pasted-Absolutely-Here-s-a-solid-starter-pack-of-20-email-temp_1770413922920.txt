Bonus: “Template Suggestion” Logic (copy/paste note for Replit)

Trigger a “save as template?” prompt when:
	•	the same reply (or highly similar) is used 3+ times in 30 days OR 5 times total
	•	or the same workflow sequence occurs 3+ times (e.g., email arrives → create task → set due date → tag)

When detected, propose:
	•	Email template (subject/body)
	•	Process macro (steps)
	•	Automation rule (trigger/conditions/actions)
	•	Board template (if it’s a consistent matter setup)

⸻

If you want, next I can generate 10 more templates specifically for medical litigation admin pain (liens/subrogation, records fees, billing disputes, provider non-response escalation, treatment gap explanation, insurance PIP/MedPay coordination), plus a Board Template Package that pairs these templates with automations (intake → records → demand → discovery → depo → settlement).
