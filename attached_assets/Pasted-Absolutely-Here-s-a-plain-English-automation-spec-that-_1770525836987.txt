Absolutely. Here’s a plain-English automation spec that’s specifically about e-filing / Green Filing, recognizing discovery, and autobuilding the next motion/document + deadlines—written so Replit can turn it into an implementation plan.

VERICASE: E-Filing + Green Filing Automation Brain (Plain English Spec)

Goal

When we add a new client and attach a case/matter, the system should automatically:
	1.	create the correct boards/templates,
	2.	populate fields from case data,
	3.	ingest filings + discovery documents (from e-filing/Green Filing uploads or email),
	4.	recognize what each document is (complaint, summons, RFP, responses, motion, order, notice, etc.),
	5.	compute all relevant deadlines and dependencies,
	6.	generate the next required document(s) in draft form,
	7.	sequence tasks so “this must be filed before that,”
	8.	keep updating as new filings come in.

This must be running before the attorney starts using the system so onboarding a matter immediately becomes organized + actionable.

⸻

Core User Experience (What the lawyer sees)

Matter creation
	•	User creates/enters a client
	•	User creates/attaches a matter/case (case number, court, judge, parties, filing state)
	•	Immediately, the app:
	•	creates a “Matter Board”
	•	creates linked boards (Discovery, Pleadings, Motions, Hearings, Deadlines, Service, Billing)
	•	fills in case info fields automatically (parties, counsel, court address, case type, deadlines baseline)

Auto-updating workflow
	•	As soon as documents are uploaded/imported, the app:
	•	classifies them (what they are)
	•	extracts key dates (filed date, service date, hearing date)
	•	calculates deadlines
	•	creates/updates tasks and statuses (Draft → Review → Final → File → Served)
	•	generates draft documents where possible

⸻

System Components (Conceptual Modules)

1) Intake Sources (E-filing + Green Filing + Email + Manual)

The system can ingest docs from:
	•	Green Filing export / upload bundle
	•	e-filing PDFs (notices, orders, motions, certificates)
	•	Email attachments (if enabled)
	•	Manual uploads

Each ingestion creates a “Document Record” linked to the matter.

Ingestion job steps:
	1.	Save original PDF (immutable).
	2.	OCR and extract text.
	3.	Extract metadata (caption, case number, filing date, title, party, attorney, certificate of service).
	4.	Pass to classifier.

⸻

2) Document Classifier (What is this document?)

For every document, output a structured classification:
	•	Document Type (one of):
	•	Complaint / Petition
	•	Summons
	•	Proof/Certificate of Service
	•	Answer
	•	Motion (with subtype: MSJ, MTD, Compel, Protective Order, etc.)
	•	Notice (hearing, deposition, appearance, etc.)
	•	Order (signed/unsigned)
	•	Discovery Request (RFP, Interrogatories, Requests for Admission)
	•	Discovery Response
	•	Disclosure / Initial Disclosures
	•	Subpoena
	•	Settlement / Stipulation
	•	Other
	•	Key extracted facts:
	•	filed_date
	•	served_date (if present)
	•	response_deadline_anchor_date (usually service date)
	•	hearing_date (if notice)
	•	judge/court
	•	parties involved
	•	document relationships (e.g., “Response to Plaintiff’s First RFP” links to the “First RFP”)

Important: Discovery detection must recognize:
	•	“Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories”
	•	“Requests for Production”
	•	“Requests for Admission”
	•	“Notice of Service”
	•	“Certificate of Service”
	•	“Responses and Objections”

⸻

3) Deadline Engine (Compute deadlines from events)

The deadline engine is a rules system that turns recognized events into:
	•	deadlines
	•	dependent tasks
	•	filing sequencing

It uses:
	•	jurisdiction rules (state + court)
	•	rule templates (Utah, federal, etc.)
	•	case-type overrides (civil, family, etc.)
	•	service method rules (mail/electronic/personal)
	•	weekend/holiday adjustments

Inputs (anchors):
	•	Filing date (from court stamp / docket)
	•	Service date (from certificate of service or notice)
	•	Hearing date (from notice)
	•	Order signed date
	•	Scheduling order dates (big one)

Outputs:
	•	Deadlines with:
	•	due_date
	•	due_time (if known)
	•	rule_source (e.g., “URCP 26”)
	•	dependency (depends_on_event_id)
	•	criticality (hard/soft)
	•	what must happen (draft / file / serve)

Examples:
	•	If document type = Discovery Request and served_date exists:
	•	create deadline: “Discovery responses due” = served_date + X days (jurisdiction-dependent)
	•	If motion filed:
	•	create deadlines: “Opposition due” and “Reply due” based on rules
	•	If scheduling order received:
	•	parse its dates and overwrite baseline deadlines

⸻

4) Sequencing Engine (“What must go out next?”)

This engine decides the next action.

It looks at:
	•	current case phase (pleadings, discovery, motions, trial prep)
	•	what has been filed/served
	•	what is overdue or upcoming
	•	dependencies (“can’t file reply before opposition”)

It generates a “Next Best Actions” list:
	•	next document that must be drafted
	•	next filing that must be served
	•	prep tasks required before filing

Output objects:
	•	Action name (e.g., “Draft Responses to RFP Set 1”)
	•	Required doc template (which generator to use)
	•	Due date + days remaining
	•	Status pipeline (Draft → Review → Final → File/Serve)
	•	Assigned to (Lauren or staff)

⸻

5) Document Builder (Auto-create drafts from matter data)

When the sequencing engine decides a doc needs to exist, it can create a draft:

Draft creation:
	•	Select template based on:
	•	doc type
	•	jurisdiction/court
	•	party role (plaintiff/defendant)
	•	Fill caption automatically from case data:
	•	court, case number, parties, judge
	•	Pull facts from matter profile:
	•	party addresses, counsel info, service method, dates
	•	Pull relevant referenced documents:
	•	discovery request text to respond to
	•	motion being opposed for an opposition template

Draft output:
	•	Creates a “Draft Document Record”
	•	Adds it to the board with status = Draft
	•	Links it to the triggering filing/discovery item
	•	Creates tasks:
	•	“Review draft”
	•	“Finalize”
	•	“File”
	•	“Serve”
	•	“Confirm docket entry”

⸻

Automation Triggers (When things happen)

Trigger A: Create new matter/case

When a matter is created or linked:
	1.	Create boards:
	•	Master Matter Board
	•	Discovery Board
	•	Motions Board
	•	Deadlines Board
	•	Filings Board
	•	Evidence/Docs Board
	2.	Populate matter fields:
	•	case number, court, judge, party roles
	3.	Create baseline tasks:
	•	“Confirm service date”
	•	“Check scheduling order”
	•	“Set disclosures / discovery plan”
	4.	Turn on watchers:
	•	Document intake watcher (uploads/email)
	•	Deadline recalculation watcher

Trigger B: New document ingested

When a document is added:
	1.	OCR
	2.	Classify
	3.	Extract dates + relationships
	4.	Create timeline event
	5.	Recompute deadlines
	6.	Update boards
	7.	Generate “next actions”
	8.	If a required document is missing and deadline is near:
	•	auto-create draft from template

Trigger C: Docket update / e-filing event

When a filing confirmation is added:
	1.	mark related tasks as “Filed”
	2.	log confirmation details
	3.	create next dependency deadlines (opposition/reply, etc.)

“Green Filing / e-filing” Specific Behavior

Green Filing intake assumptions

Green Filing outputs usually include:
	•	a PDF
	•	a filing receipt / confirmation page
	•	service list or notice

The system should:
	•	detect the confirmation page
	•	extract:
	•	exact filed timestamp
	•	document title as filed
	•	served parties list
	•	attach that to the document record as “filing proof”

Discovery recognition rules

If doc title or first page includes:
	•	“Interrogatories”
	•	“Requests for Production”
	•	“Requests for Admission”
	•	“Notice of Service”
then classify as Discovery Request.
If includes “Responses and Objections” then classify as Discovery Response.
If both appear, classify as Response and link to the originating request.

⸻

The “Already running” requirement (preloaded automations)

Before attorney uses it, ship with:
	•	Board templates for civil litigation
	•	Baseline rules for discovery response deadlines
	•	Motions/opposition/reply timeline rules
	•	Scheduling order parser placeholder (can start manual)
	•	Auto-draft templates:
	•	Discovery responses shell
	•	Motion to compel shell
	•	Notice of hearing shell
	•	Certificate of service shell

Even if the drafts are “structured shells,” it’s still huge value.

⸻

What counts as success

When a case is added + docs are uploaded:
	•	the app correctly identifies filings/discovery type
	•	deadlines appear automatically
	•	the board fills itself with next tasks
	•	drafts appear automatically when appropriate
	•	everything stays linked and updates when new filings arrive

⸻

Important guardrails
	•	Deadlines must be reviewable: show the anchor event and rule name.
	•	Never silently auto-file: only move to “Ready to File.”
	•	Keep audit trail: who approved, what was generated, what rule triggered it.
	•	If rule set is unknown, create “Needs rules setup” warnings and default to conservative assumptions.

That’s your “Replit-readable” plain English spec for e-filing + discovery recognition + deadline sequencing + auto-drafting inside a Clio-meets-Monday app.

If you want to go even sharper: you can paste your jurisdiction (Utah? Federal? both) and I’ll write the rule engine inputs/outputs in a cleaner “IF/THEN” format Replit agents tend to nail on the first pass.
