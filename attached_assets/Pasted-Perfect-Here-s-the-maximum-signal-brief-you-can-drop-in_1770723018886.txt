Perfect. Here’s the “maximum signal” brief you can drop into Replit/your dev channel so the team can implement best-practice Monday-style board UX without guessing. I’m grounding this in your actual code layout (from the ZIP):
	•	client/src/pages/board.tsx
	•	client/src/components/board/task-group.tsx
	•	client/src/components/board/task-row.tsx
	•	client/src/components/board/column-header.tsx
	•	client/src/components/board/board-header.tsx
	•	client/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx
	•	DB shape supports it: boards already have matterId + clientId (shared/models/tables.ts).

⸻

0) Core principle: one scroll, one header, one frozen lane

Right now each group has its own horizontal scroller (TaskGroup has overflow-x-auto). That’s the #1 reason boards feel “fussy” instead of “pro.”

Best practice:
	•	One horizontal scroll container for the entire grid (not per group)
	•	One global column header row (sticky)
	•	Frozen left lane (checkbox + task title)

This unlocks:
	•	smooth side scroll
	•	consistent gridlines
	•	sticky header that actually works
	•	jump-to-column that isn’t janky

⸻

1) Table view architecture refactor (minimal, high impact)

✅ Change in client/src/pages/board.tsx

Replace the current table wrapper:

{activeView === "table" && (
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-auto p-4">
    ...
  </div>
)}

With a 2-layer scroll layout:
	•	Vertical scroll on the page area
	•	Horizontal scroll on the grid container
	•	Grid gets min-w-max so it can exceed viewport width naturally

Conceptually (not exact code you must use, but this structure):

<div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
  <div className="h-full overflow-y-auto p-4">
    <div id="boardGridScroll" className="overflow-x-auto rounded-md border bg-background">
      <div className="min-w-max">
        {/* Global sticky column header row goes here */}
        {/* Then TaskGroup blocks (without their own overflow-x) */}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

✅ Change in client/src/components/board/task-group.tsx

Remove the per-group horizontal scrolling:

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  <div className="min-w-max">

…and just render the group’s header + rows directly.

Result: one scrollbar, not 12.

⸻

2) Global sticky column header row (table view)

Currently the header row is inside each TaskGroup, meaning:
	•	it repeats
	•	it can’t be sticky correctly across groups
	•	gridlines don’t line up globally

Best practice

Add a single “TableHeaderRow” component rendered once above the groups:
	•	checkbox spacer column
	•	“Task” column
	•	visible columns mapped
	•	optional “+” column center button

Where to implement:
	•	Create: client/src/components/board/table-header-row.tsx
	•	Render it in board.tsx just inside the min-w-max container
	•	Delete/disable the existing header row inside TaskGroup

Then make it sticky:
	•	position: sticky
	•	top: <height of BoardHeader + ViewTabs>
	•	z-index: 50
	•	bg-background/90 + backdrop-blur (so it feels modern)

⸻

3) Frozen first columns (checkbox + task title)

This is the “I can actually use this all day” feature.

✅ Change in client/src/components/board/task-row.tsx

Make the first two cells sticky:
	•	checkbox cell: sticky left-0 z-30 bg-background
	•	task title cell: sticky left-10 z-30 bg-background

Then add a subtle divider/shadow at the edge of the frozen region so your brain reads it as pinned:
	•	shadow-[2px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.04)] or similar on the title cell container

You’ll also do the same stickiness for the global header row cells in your new header component.

⸻

4) Vertical gridlines + scan-friendly rails (what you asked for)

You already have the start of this: TaskRow uses border-l border-border/20 on cells.

Best practice tweaks
	•	Make gridlines slightly stronger: border-border/30 or /40
	•	Apply the same rule to:
	•	header row cells
	•	summary row cells (your GroupSummaryRow)

“Major rails” (pro readability)

Make stronger separators after:
	•	Task column
	•	Status column (if present)

That’s how Monday feels “organized” without being visually loud.

⸻

5) Side-scroll navigation tools (premium feel, easy win)

Once you have one grid scroller (#boardGridScroll), you can add:

A) Scroll nudge buttons (instant value)

Add two buttons near columns/search:
	•	◀ scroll left by 480px
	•	▶ scroll right by 480px

Implementation: document.getElementById('boardGridScroll')?.scrollBy({ left: 480, behavior: 'smooth' })

B) Jump-to-column dropdown

Use your existing column list (board.columns.filter(c => c.visible)):
	•	dropdown shows column titles
	•	on select, scroll that column into view (by querying a data-col-id attribute on the header cell)

C) Sticky horizontal scrollbar (optional)

If you want a “bottom scrollbar always visible,” you can mirror scroll position into a thin fixed bar at bottom of board view.

⸻

6) “Not Started / In Progress / Completed” per section (per group)

You already have showCompleted logic. Expand that to 3 buckets.

Best practice (fast + clean)

Inside TaskGroup, compute:
	•	Not Started: status === "not-started"
	•	In Progress: status in ["working-on-it","stuck","pending-review"]
	•	Completed: status === "done"

Then provide one of two UIs:

Option 1: segmented filter (fastest)
Use your existing shadcn toggle-group (components/ui/toggle-group.tsx is present):
	•	All | Not Started | In Progress | Completed

Option 2: swimlanes (best UX)
Render three mini-sections under the group with headings + counts:
	•	Not Started (12)
	•	In Progress (3)
	•	Completed (9)

This makes sections feel like workflows, not piles.

⸻

7) Collapsible sidebar tree: Case → Client → Boards

Your sidebar currently lists boards flat in client/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx.

But your DB already supports hierarchy:
	•	boards.matterId
	•	boards.clientId

Best practice UX features
	•	collapsible chevrons for Case and Client
	•	search input filters tree + auto-expands matches
	•	pinned boards at top
	•	recents section (last 5 visited)
	•	persist open/close state in localStorage

Implementation approach (client-only first)

In AppSidebar:
	•	fetch matters: GET /api/matters
	•	fetch clients: GET /api/clients
	•	you already fetch boards with workspace filter

Then build a tree:
	•	matter → clients → boards
	•	matter → boards (if no clientId)

Render it with your existing shadcn Collapsible (components/ui/collapsible.tsx exists).

Persist state like:
	•	sidebarTreeOpen: { matterId: true/false, clientId: true/false }

This is the exact “collapsible boards by case/client” you asked for.

⸻

8) Responsive / adaptive polish (the stuff that quietly screams “expensive”)

These are small but high ROI:

A) Density toggle (Comfort / Compact / Ultra-compact)

Tie it to a CSS class on the grid container:
	•	changes row height, font size, padding
	•	store in localStorage or user profile

B) Sticky shadows

When header is sticky: subtle bottom shadow
When left columns frozen: subtle right shadow

C) Hover + focus states
	•	row hover highlight
	•	cell focus ring when editing (reduces “where am I?”)

D) Virtualization (later, but inevitable)

Once boards go big (500+ rows), add @tanstack/react-virtual for rows.
Not required for this sprint, but plan it.

⸻

9) “Best practices” checklist Replit can evaluate

Hand this list to the agent/devs:
	1.	✅ Only one horizontal scroller for table view (not per group)
	2.	✅ Global sticky column header row
	3.	✅ Frozen checkbox + task name columns
	4.	✅ Consistent gridlines for header/rows/summary
	5.	✅ Column jump + scroll nudges
	6.	✅ Group workflow (All/Not started/In progress/Completed)
	7.	✅ Sidebar tree: Case → Client → Boards with collapse/search/pins/recents
	8.	✅ Density toggle
	9.	✅ No layout shift when opening modals/menus
	10.	✅ Works on laptop widths (1366px) without pain

⸻

If you want the team to move fast, tell them to implement in this order:
	1.	One horizontal scroller + remove group scrollers
	2.	Global header row + sticky
	3.	Frozen left columns
	4.	Gridlines + shadows
	5.	Group workflow lanes
	6.	Sidebar tree

That sequence gives you “Monday-grade” feel early and prevents rework.
