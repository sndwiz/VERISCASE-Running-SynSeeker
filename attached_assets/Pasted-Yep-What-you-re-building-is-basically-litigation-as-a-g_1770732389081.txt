Yep. What you’re building is basically “litigation as a guided checklist + deadline brain”—Clio for the data, Monday for the execution, with prompts that feel like how lawyers actually run a file.

Below is a jurisdiction-agnostic (but realistic) process map you can encode. Treat it like a default playbook your app can load as templates, then let firms/jurisdictions customize the rule timing.

⸻

1) The core idea: Matter Setup → Phase Gates → Deadline Engine → Prompted Workflows

Your app should do 4 things for every matter:
	1.	Create the matter exactly like filings
	•	parties, roles, court, case number, judge, venue, claims/causes, service info
	2.	Apply a workflow template
	•	“General Civil Litigation” or “Medical Malpractice / PI”
	3.	Generate deadlines from trigger dates
	•	filing date, service date, answer date, scheduling order dates, discovery cutoff, expert deadlines, trial date
	4.	Prompt next-best actions
	•	based on what’s done + what’s due + what’s missing (evidence gaps)

⸻

2) A “Litigation Attorney” default workflow (civil litigation)

Think in phases. Every phase has: required inputs → outputs → triggers → next prompts.

Phase A — Intake & Pre-suit

Goal: decide whether to file; preserve evidence; start damages file.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Conflict check, engagement letter, fee agreement
	•	Fact intake: timeline, people/orgs, locations
	•	Evidence hold: preservation letter / litigation hold
	•	Collect: contracts, emails/texts, photos, recordings, invoices, medical
	•	Identify claims + defenses + jurisdiction/venue logic
	•	Pre-suit demand (optional): draft + send + set response deadline
App output:
	•	Matter “Facts Timeline v1”
	•	Evidence inventory + missing items list
	•	Damages ledger started

Trigger to advance: “Suit authorized” or “Demand rejected/no response.”

⸻

Phase B — Pleadings & Service

Goal: get the case on file correctly and get everyone served.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Draft complaint/petition (with exhibits list)
	•	Filing checklist (court format, caption, verification, fees)
	•	Service package: summons + complaint + instructions
	•	Track service returns + proof of service
	•	Defendant answer deadline tracking (depends on jurisdiction/service type)

App should ask for these key dates:
	•	filing date
	•	each defendant service date
	•	answer/response due date(s)

Trigger to advance: all defendants served + answers in (or defaults handled).

⸻

Phase C — Early Case Management / Scheduling

Goal: lock the calendar and scope.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Case management statement / scheduling conference prep
	•	Proposed discovery plan / protective order (common)
	•	Initial disclosures (if applicable)
	•	Calendar: discovery cutoff, expert deadlines, dispositive motion deadline, pretrial order, trial date
	•	Identify key issues for discovery plan

Outputs:
	•	“Scheduling Order” captured in the matter
	•	Deadline matrix auto-created (your app becomes the “deadline truth”)

Trigger: scheduling order entered.

⸻

Phase D — Written Discovery (start early, run continuously)

Goal: build admissible record; pin down facts; force production.
Prompts/tasks (defense/plantiff both use these):
	•	Draft + serve: Interrogatories, Requests for Production, Requests for Admission
	•	Third-party subpoenas (phone, bank, employer, surveillance, etc.)
	•	Meet-and-confer tracker for deficiencies
	•	Rolling production log + privilege log prompts
	•	“Hot document” triage and contradiction finder (where your AI shines)

App needs to track:
	•	service dates for each discovery set
	•	response due dates
	•	extension agreements
	•	deficiency letters + deadlines to cure

Trigger: responses received + reviewed; disputes flagged.

⸻

Phase E — Depositions

Goal: testimony locked, impeachment built.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Depo plan by witness category (party, key witness, expert, custodian)
	•	Notice/subpoena process
	•	Exhibit bundles + authentication plan
	•	Depo summaries + “impeachment clips” list

Trigger: key depositions complete.

⸻

Phase F — Experts (often the turning point)

Goal: admissible opinions + reports + deposition strategy.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Expert retention + engagement
	•	Provide records package + timeline
	•	Expert report deadline + disclosure compliance
	•	Rebuttal experts (if needed)
	•	Expert depos scheduled

Trigger: expert discovery closed.

⸻

Phase G — Motion Practice

Goal: narrow issues, exclude evidence, win early if possible.
Prompt types (very standard):
	•	Motion to dismiss / pleadings motions (early)
	•	Motion to compel (during discovery disputes)
	•	Summary judgment / dispositive (after discovery)
	•	Motions in limine (pretrial)
	•	Daubert/Frye challenges (experts)

App should prompt motions when:
	•	discovery dispute exists + meet-and-confer logged + deadline approaching
	•	dispositive motion deadline is X days away and key evidence is ready/not ready
	•	trial is near and exhibit/witness lists are incomplete

⸻

Phase H — Pretrial & Trial

Goal: exhibits authenticated, lists filed, story locked.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Final witness list, exhibit list
	•	Exhibit numbering + binders + electronic exhibit set
	•	Pretrial order drafting
	•	Jury instructions/voir dire (if jury)
	•	Trial brief (optional)
	•	Trial calendar (daily schedule, witness order)

Trigger: case concluded or post-trial motions.

⸻

Phase I — Settlement / ADR (runs parallel)

Goal: resolution on favorable terms.
Prompts/tasks:
	•	Settlement demand package (liability + damages + exhibits)
	•	Mediation statement + confidential exhibits
	•	Authority tracking, offers/counteroffers log
	•	Draft settlement agreement + releases

⸻

3) A “Medical Attorney” default workflow (PI / Med Mal)

This is litigation + extra layers: records, causation, experts, liens, damages math.

Phase A — Intake + Records + Screening

Prompts/tasks:
	•	HIPAA authorizations signed
	•	Request records from: hospitals, clinics, EMS, imaging, pharmacy
	•	Build medical timeline (visits, meds, imaging, procedures)
	•	Baseline damages: lost wages, out-of-pocket, future care
	•	Early case screen: statute limitations + notice-of-claim rules (varies)
	•	Identify standard-of-care theory + causation theory (initial)

Output:
	•	“Medical Timeline v1”
	•	Provider list + facility list + record request status board
	•	Potential defendants list

⸻

Phase B — Pre-suit requirements (med mal often has them)

Many places have some version of: pre-suit notice, affidavit/certificate of merit, screening panel, etc. (varies a lot).

App should be configurable here, but default prompts:
	•	“Is this jurisdiction requiring pre-suit notice/cert of merit?” (firm sets once per jurisdiction template)
	•	If yes: generate the required checklist + dates.

⸻

Phase C — Filing + Service (same, but with med-specific exhibits)

Prompts/tasks:
	•	Complaint/petition + defendants proper names/entities
	•	Service + track returns
	•	Put all providers and insurance carriers into contacts

⸻

Phase D — Medical discovery engine (the big one)

Prompts/tasks:
	•	Subpoenas for complete medical file + billing
	•	Imaging (DICOM) retrieval & review
	•	Provider depositions / custodian-of-records depositions
	•	Create “record completeness” checklist:
	•	ED notes, nursing notes, MAR, orders, op notes, labs, radiology, billing, discharge, follow-up

⸻

Phase E — Experts + Causation package

This is where med cases are won/lost.

Prompts/tasks:
	•	Retain experts: standard of care, causation, damages/life care, economics
	•	Create expert packet: full records + timeline + key excerpts + questions list
	•	Disclosure deadlines + report tracking

⸻

Phase F — Liens + Settlement mechanics (PI-specific reality)

Prompts/tasks:
	•	Identify liens (Medicare/Medicaid/ERISA/private)
	•	Notice requirements, conditional payment amounts
	•	Negotiate reductions, finalize demand
	•	Settlement distribution worksheet + closing checklist

⸻

4) How your app should “prompt” like a real firm

The magic is not a static checklist. It’s a rules engine that asks for trigger dates and then generates tasks.

Matter setup questions (minimum)
	•	Jurisdiction / venue / court
	•	Case type template (civil, PI, med mal, employment, etc.)
	•	Filing date (when it exists)
	•	Service date per defendant (when it happens)
	•	Scheduling order dates (when received)
	•	Trial date (if set)
	•	ADR/mediation date (if set)

Trigger-based automations (examples)
	•	When filing date entered → create service tasks + default response deadline placeholders
	•	When service date entered → auto-calc answer/response due + set reminders + “default risk” flag
	•	When scheduling order uploaded → parse dates → populate discovery cutoff / expert deadlines / dispositive deadline
	•	When discovery served → response due date tasks + deficiency review tasks
	•	When responses received → auto-create “review & deficiency” workflow
	•	When depo scheduled → auto-create prep checklist + exhibit list + depo summary tasks
	•	When expert retained → auto-create packet build + disclosure/report deadlines

5) What to build in your Clio×Monday UI

For each matter template, generate these boards automatically:

Boards every litigation matter should get
	1.	Case Overview (phase, deadlines, key contacts)
	2.	Pleadings & Filings (everything filed + upcoming)
	3.	Discovery Tracker (served/received/deficiencies)
	4.	Depositions (witness list + status)
	5.	Evidence / Exhibits (inventory + authentication status)
	6.	Motions (pipeline + drafting + filing)
	7.	Settlement / ADR (offers, mediation prep)

Additional boards for medical/PI
	8.	Medical Records (provider list + request status)
	9.	Medical Timeline (events, visits, procedures)
	10.	Damages & Liens (ledger + lien tracking)

And inside each section/group, your “Not Started / In Progress / Completed” swimlanes fit perfectly.

⸻

If you tell me the jurisdiction(s) you care about most (even just “Utah state court” vs “federal”), I can convert this into a rule table (trigger → deadline formula → tasks created) that your app can execute automatically.
