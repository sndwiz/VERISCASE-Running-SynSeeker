Yep. Your “screen record → replay → automation” button is secretly one of the highest-leverage features in the whole app. It turns tribal process knowledge into repeatable machine behavior without users having to think like programmers.

Here’s a comprehensive, Replit-ready plain-English spec for:
	1.	Beefing up the Screen Recorder → Automation Builder
	2.	Expanding Calendar
	3.	Adding a Simple Outlook-like Mail module designed specifically for your Clio x Monday x CRM system

VERICASE Feature: Screen Recorder → Automation Builder (Process Capture)

Goal

Let users “record what I did” inside VERICASE and turn it into:
	•	a reusable automation rule (Trigger → Conditions → Actions), AND/OR
	•	a reusable “macro” they can run manually, AND/OR
	•	a guided template/checklist for onboarding.

This is how you bottle workflows.

⸻

1) What to record (events)

When recording is ON, capture a stream of app events (not video pixels).

Event types to capture
	•	Navigation:
	•	opened board, item, matter, client
	•	CRUD actions:
	•	created item/task/event
	•	updated fields (status, due date, assignee, tags, custom fields)
	•	moved item/group/board
	•	created columns/groups
	•	Comments/messages:
	•	posted comment
	•	@mentions and #tags
	•	File actions:
	•	uploaded file
	•	linked file to item
	•	ran OCR
	•	routed file
	•	Calendar actions:
	•	created event
	•	edited time, attendees
	•	Email actions (once you add it):
	•	linked email thread to matter
	•	created task from email
	•	Detective Board actions (optional):
	•	created hypothesis
	•	linked entities

Each recorded event should include:
	•	timestamp
	•	user_id
	•	scope ids (board_id, item_id, matter_id)
	•	before/after values (for updates)
	•	metadata (what column changed, what tag added, etc.)

⸻

2) Recorder output types (3 modes)

After user stops recording, show: “What do you want this to become?”

A) “Automation Rule”

Turns recording into a Trigger→Conditions→Actions rule that runs automatically.

B) “Manual Macro”

A one-click script the user can run on demand:
	•	“Apply this cleanup process to selected items”

C) “SOP / Playbook”

Turns it into a checklist + explanation:
	•	training / onboarding / compliance doc
	•	optionally with AI-generated plain-English narration

⸻

3) Turning recordings into automations (the translation)

Recorded actions alone aren’t an automation until you infer:
	•	Trigger: what starts it?
	•	Scope: where does it run?
	•	Parameters: what parts vary (dates, assignees, statuses)?
	•	Conditions: when should it NOT run?
	•	Loop guards: avoid repeating forever

Translation rules (MVP)
	•	If recording began right after an identifiable event (e.g., file upload, status change), propose that as trigger.
	•	If no obvious event, default trigger to:
	•	manual.run_macro (manual macro), or
	•	item.updated with conditions (automation rule) only if user chooses.

Parameterization (key)

When actions refer to specific values, ask the user to generalize:
	•	“Assign to Alex” → “Assign to item’s assignee?” or “Assign to role: Lead Attorney?”
	•	“Due date = Feb 12” → “Due date = detected deadline” or “NOW + 7 days”
	•	“Move to group Urgent” → keep or select a group variable

⸻

4) Other killer uses (beyond automation generation)

Your recorder can do way more than “make automations.”

1) Guided templates (“Board Setup Wizard by Example”)

Record setting up a board once → replay it to create new boards/matters with identical structure.

2) QA + audit (“Who changed what and why”)

Recording events creates a clean, human-readable change trail:
	•	“These 12 actions were performed during intake.”

3) AI coaching (“You keep doing this manually—want it automated?”)

Detect repeated patterns of recorded sequences:
	•	If a user repeats the same 8-step flow three times, auto-suggest:
	•	“Turn this into a macro/automation?”

4) Timekeeping + billing assist (careful, but useful)

Turn recorded sequences into time entries suggestions:
	•	“You spent 18 minutes on intake tasks.” (proposal-only)

5) Reproduce complex “investigation workflows”

Record the steps of building a Detective Board hypothesis and turning it into tasks.

⸻

5) Data model (minimum)

process_recordings
	•	id
	•	created_by_user_id
	•	scope_type (board/matter/client)
	•	scope_id
	•	started_at
	•	ended_at
	•	status (draft/converted)
	•	title (user editable)

process_events
	•	id
	•	recording_id
	•	ts
	•	event_type
	•	payload_json (before/after + ids)

process_conversions
	•	id
	•	recording_id
	•	output_type (automation_rule | macro | sop)
	•	generated_json (rule/macro steps)
	•	status (draft/approved/active)

Uses your existing:
	•	automation_rules
	•	action_proposals
	•	audit_log

⸻

6) Recorder UX
	•	Button: “Record Process”
	•	Shows:
	•	“Recording… 12 steps”
	•	Stop → summary:
	•	“You changed 3 items, created 2 tasks, uploaded 1 file”
	•	Then:
	•	“Convert to: Automation / Macro / Playbook”
	•	Show plan → approve → activate (same pattern)

VERICASE Feature: Calendar 2.0 (Legal + CRM aware)

Goal

A calendar that’s not generic. It must understand:
	•	matters
	•	deadlines
	•	hearings/meetings
	•	tasks
	•	board statuses
	•	and email/call follow-ups

Calendar becomes the “time spine” of your whole system.

⸻

1) Calendar objects

Support:
	•	Events (meeting/hearing/call)
	•	Deadlines (court dates, filing deadlines, follow-up deadlines)
	•	Tasks with due dates (optional overlay)

Every calendar entry should be linkable to:
	•	matter_id
	•	board_id
	•	item_id
	•	evidence file(s) + citations (if derived from OCR)

⸻

2) Views
	•	Day / Week / Month
	•	Matter view (filter by matter)
	•	Assignee view (filter by user)
	•	“Deadlines only”
	•	“Court dates only”
	•	“Overdue follow-ups”

⸻

3) Ingestion and proposals

Calendar should accept proposed events from:
	•	OCR deadline detection
	•	Board Chat “Detected actions”
	•	Email module (below)
	•	Screen recorder conversion

Always: propose → approve → create.

⸻

4) Calendar automations (native)

Examples:
	•	“3 days before court date, notify lead attorney + paralegal”
	•	“If deadline moves, update linked tasks”

⸻

⸻

VERICASE Feature: Mail Lite (Outlook-ish, but purpose-built)

Goal

A simple email hub that supports this system’s workflows:
	•	pull in / forward emails into VERICASE
	•	link threads to matters/boards/items
	•	turn emails into tasks/deadlines
	•	store attachments into the right place
	•	allow comments and internal chat around threads

Not a full Outlook clone. A case communication inbox.

⸻

1) Email ingestion methods (choose MVP)

MVP Option A: Forwarding address (simplest)
	•	Each matter gets a unique email like:
	•	matter+ABC123@vericase.yourdomain.com
User forwards emails there and VERICASE ingests them.

MVP Option B: OAuth mailbox connect (later)

Connect Gmail/Outlook accounts and ingest selected folders/labels.
(Heavier compliance + admin effort.)

Start with forwarding. It’s the least messy.

⸻

2) What happens on ingest

For each email:
	•	store raw email metadata:
	•	from, to, cc, subject, date, message-id, thread-id
	•	store body (sanitized)
	•	store attachments as files
	•	run extraction/OCR on attachments
	•	create linking suggestions:
	•	which matter?
	•	which board/item?
	•	who should be assigned?

Then show a routing proposal card:
	•	“Link this thread to Matter X”
	•	“Create task: respond by Friday”
	•	“Save attachments to Evidence folder”
User approves.

⸻

3) Email UI (simple, effective)
	•	Left: folders (Inbox, Linked to Matters, Unlinked, Needs Review)
	•	Center: thread list (subject, linked matter, tags, last activity)
	•	Right: thread details:
	•	full conversation
	•	attachments
	•	“Create task” button
	•	“Link to matter” button
	•	internal notes/comments (not sent externally)

Support:
	•	@mentions and #tags inside internal comments
	•	“Convert to automation” for repeated email workflows (ties into recorder)

⸻

4) Email-to-task and email-to-deadline intelligence

On each email/thread:
	•	detect deadlines (“by Friday”, “due Feb 10”)
	•	detect action items (“please send”, “need you to file”)
	•	detect key entities (names, addresses) for matter linking

Always: propose → approve.

⸻

5) Mail automations (Monday-style)

Examples:
	•	Trigger: email.received_in_matter_inbox
	•	Conditions: sender domain, keywords, attachments present
	•	Actions:
	•	create task “Respond”
	•	assign attorney
	•	set due date +2 days
	•	route attachments to folder
	•	tag thread #client-comms

⸻

6) Data model (minimum)

email_accounts (if you do OAuth later)
	•	id, provider, auth tokens (encrypted), user_id

emails
	•	id
	•	thread_id
	•	matter_id (nullable)
	•	board_id/item_id (nullable)
	•	from/to/cc
	•	subject
	•	sent_at
	•	body_text
	•	body_html (optional)
	•	status (unlinked/linked/needs_review)
	•	created_at

email_attachments
	•	id
	•	email_id
	•	file_id

email_internal_comments
	•	id
	•	email_id
	•	user_id
	•	text
	•	entities_json (@mentions/#tags)
	•	created_at

⸻

7) Security and privacy
	•	All email ingest and AI summarization must use your Model Gateway
	•	Redaction/minimization
	•	Audit logs
	•	No automatic sending emails in MVP (safe). Start with ingest + internal workflow.

⸻

⸻

Recommended build order (so this actually ships)
	1.	Screen recorder logs events + plays back as manual macro
	2.	Convert macro → automation rule (simple parameter prompts)
	3.	Calendar upgrades: unified events/deadlines/tasks view + linking
	4.	Email forwarding inbox per matter + attachment ingest + proposals
	5.	Email → tasks/deadlines proposals + calendar linking
	6.	“Record process” that includes email/calendar actions → automation templates

⸻

If you want the cleanest next deliverable to paste into Replit, I can turn this into three separate “tickets” with acceptance criteria:
	•	Ticket A: Screen Recorder → Macro → Automation
	•	Ticket B: Calendar 2.0
	•	Ticket C: Mail Lite (forwarding-based)

That way your builder can implement without interpreting your intentions like a horoscope.
