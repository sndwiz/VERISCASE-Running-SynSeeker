WITNESS STATEMENT OF SARAH MARTINEZ
Case No. 2025-CV-04821
Date: January 15, 2025

I, Sarah Martinez, hereby provide this sworn statement regarding the motor vehicle accident that occurred on December 3, 2024, at approximately 2:15 PM at the intersection of Main Street and Oak Avenue in Salt Lake City, Utah.

BACKGROUND:
I was driving my 2022 Honda Civic westbound on Main Street, approaching the intersection with Oak Avenue. The traffic light was green in my direction. I was traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour, which is the posted speed limit for that road.

ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT:
As I entered the intersection, the defendant's vehicle — a black Ford F-150 pickup truck — ran the red light at high speed from Oak Avenue and struck the passenger side of my vehicle with tremendous force. I had absolutely no time to react. The impact was so violent that my vehicle was pushed sideways approximately 25 feet into the westbound lane.

I remember the sound of the collision vividly. It was a terrible, deafening crash. Glass shattered everywhere. My airbags deployed immediately. I was pinned in my seat by the force of the impact.

INJURIES:
I suffered severe injuries including a fractured left clavicle, three broken ribs on my left side, a concussion, and extensive bruising across my torso and left arm. The pain was excruciating and immediate. I was unable to move my left arm at all.

WITNESSES:
There were at least four other vehicles stopped at the intersection. A man from a silver SUV — I later learned his name was Robert Chen — rushed to my vehicle and called 911 immediately. He told me he saw everything and that the truck "blew right through the red light."

EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
Paramedics arrived within approximately 8 minutes. I was transported by ambulance to University of Utah Hospital where I was admitted for three days. I underwent surgery to repair my fractured clavicle with a titanium plate.

DEFENDANT'S BEHAVIOR:
From what I could see through my shattered window, the defendant — James Wheeler — appeared disoriented after the crash. I could smell alcohol. He was stumbling when he got out of his truck. He never once came to check on me or ask if I was okay. He seemed more concerned about damage to his truck.

CURRENT STATUS:
As of this statement, I am still undergoing physical therapy three times per week. I cannot lift anything over 10 pounds with my left arm. I have been unable to return to my job as a dental hygienist. The medical bills have exceeded $87,000. I continue to experience nightmares and severe anxiety about driving.

I swear under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
