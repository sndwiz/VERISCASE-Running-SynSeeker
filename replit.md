## System Architecture
VERICASE is built with a modern web stack, featuring React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM handles data persistence.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The system adopts a Monday.com-style board architecture, offering highly customizable boards with over 15 column types, dynamic column management, and group summary rows for aggregated statistics. An "Approval Column" supports legal verification workflows with audit trails. The interface includes a collapsible sidebar for navigation, theme support (dark/light mode with teal accents), and is designed to be responsive across devices. Shadcn/ui and Radix UI components, styled with Tailwind CSS, ensure a consistent and modern aesthetic.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Board System:** Customizable boards with task groups and various column types (status, priority, date, person, progress, files, email, approval, etc.). Columns can be added, removed, reordered, and their types changed dynamically. Boards support optional `clientId` and `matterId` fields for linking to specific clients and cases. The sidebar organizes boards hierarchically: general boards (All Cases, Client Documents) at top, then client-grouped case boards underneath with collapsible client sections. New matters automatically get a linked board created.
- **Vibe Code (AI App Builder):** Monday.com-style AI-powered board builder at `/vibe-code`. Users can type a natural language prompt to have Claude generate a fully configured board with columns, groups, and sample tasks. Includes 18 pre-built legal-focused templates (Case Intake, Deposition Scheduler, Discovery Tracker, Billing Dashboard, etc.) organized by category (legal, business, operations, finance). Template gallery with search/filter, quick suggestion pills, and a loading overlay during AI generation. Backend at `server/routes/vibe-code.ts`, frontend at `client/src/pages/vibe-code.tsx`.
- **AI Integration (VeriBot):** A multi-model AI assistant (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini) for legal document analysis, content generation, information extraction, and summarization, with matter-specific context injection.
- **Clawbot Gateway Integration:** Connect to OpenClaw/Clawbot for autonomous computer control, shell commands, browser automation, and file management through natural language.
- **Document & Form Maker:** AI-powered Utah legal document generation system with 5+ templates (Motion for Continuance, Motion to Dismiss, Civil Complaint, Answer to Complaint, Subpoena). Features URCP compliance checking, bilingual notice support, and a lawyer approval workflow with initialing and audit trails. Uses Claude claude-sonnet-4-5 for intelligent document generation.
- **Daily Briefing:** A personalized dashboard providing users with task summaries, deadlines, and active matter updates.
- **Filing Cabinet:** A two-layer document classification system with controlled vocabulary, metadata tracking, and Bates numbering.
- **Evidence Vault:** Immutable file storage with SHA-256 chain-of-custody tracking.
- **Detective Board:** A visual investigation board with draggable nodes and connections.
- **Automations:** Event-driven automation engine with 85+ pre-built templates, including AI-powered actions, legal compliance workflows, SynSeekr-powered actions, and integrations. An AI Automation Builder allows natural language automation creation, and a Workflow Recorder suggests automations based on user actions.
- **SynSeekr Integration:** Hybrid AI architecture connecting to a self-hosted SynSeekr server (26 Docker containers: Ollama LLMs, Qdrant vector DB, Neo4j graph DB, Presidio PII detection, Authentik SSO). Gateway service (`server/services/synseekr-client.ts`) manages connection, health checks, and proxies requests to 10+ SynSeekr endpoints (document analysis, entity extraction, RAG queries, investigations, contradiction detection, timeline extraction, AI agents Riley/Elena/David). 12 SynSeekr automation templates available. Settings UI (admin-only) supports URL/API key configuration, connection testing, and status monitoring. Sidebar shows real-time connection status indicator. Falls back to cloud APIs (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini) when SynSeekr is unavailable.
- **Communications Hub:** Clio-style communications center at `/communications` with four sections: Client Portals (share documents/bills/events with clients), Text Messages (SMS-style client messaging), Internal Messages (secure team communication), and Logs (activity/communication logging). Features left sub-navigation, search, filters, and "New" action dropdown. Frontend at `client/src/pages/communications.tsx`.
- **Legal AI Workspace (VeriBot):** Clio Work/Vincent-style AI-powered legal workspace at `/legal-ai` with three modes: VeriBot (conversational AI with matter context, jurisdiction selector, and 14 legal workflow cards), Library (saved document templates and workflow templates), and Draft (generated documents with status tracking). Workflow cards include: Ask a Research Question, Analyze a Contract, Analyze a Complaint, Document Review, Build an Argument, Compare Jurisdictions, Redline Analysis, Explore a Legal Proposition, Compare Documents, Create a Timeline, Summarize Documents, Analyze Pleadings, Analyze a Deposition, Analyze Judicial Proceedings. Filterable by category: Research, Transactional, Document Analysis, Litigation, International, Video Analysis. Frontend at `client/src/pages/legal-ai.tsx`.
- **Client Intake Forms:** Clio Grow-style intake form system at `/intake-forms` with 6 pre-built templates (General Intake, Personal Injury, Family Law, Criminal Defense, Estate Planning, Employment Law). Features detailed form preview with Synergy Law PLLC branding, privacy policy, contact fields, demographics, referral questions, and privacy acknowledgment. Frontend at `client/src/pages/intake-forms.tsx`.
- **Matter Insights:** OCR-first evidence intelligence system accessible as an "Insights" tab in matter detail view. Supports drag-drop file upload (PDF, images, Word docs, text, audio), automatic text extraction/OCR via Gemini Vision, streaming SHA-256 hashing, and AI-powered analysis using Claude Sonnet. Generates 6 insight types: themes, timeline, entities, contradictions, action items, and risks—all with document citations. Action items can be converted to board tasks. Shared types in `shared/insights-types.ts`, centralized config in `server/config/insights.ts`. Routes enforce matter-level authorization, Zod request validation, MIME type verification, rate limiting (30 uploads/min, 5 analysis/min), and paginated responses for assets/runs. Analysis service uses template-based prompt builder with Zod output validation. Ingestion pipeline uses streaming file reads, semaphore-based concurrency (max 3 jobs), and robust temp file cleanup. Frontend split into 5 subcomponents (UploadDropzone, AssetList, ScanSummaryCard, IntentDialog, ResultsViewer) with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. DB tables: `matter_assets`, `asset_text`, `text_anchors`, `text_chunks`, `insight_runs`, `insight_outputs`. Backend at `server/routes/insights.ts`, services at `server/services/ingestion-pipeline.ts`, `server/services/insights-analysis.ts`, `server/services/insights-storage.ts`. Frontend at `client/src/components/matter-insights.tsx`.
- **Matter Management:** Comprehensive lifecycle management for matters and clients, including contacts, threads, and timelines.
- **Billing System:** Complete firm billing infrastructure with four core entities: Expenses (per-matter costs with categories like filing-fees, expert-fees, travel, etc.), Invoices (with line items, status tracking, and payment reconciliation), Payments (multi-method tracking including wire, check, ACH, credit-card), and Trust Transactions (IOLTA account deposits/withdrawals with running balances). Three dashboard levels: Master Billing Dashboard (`/billing`) for firm-wide KPIs, Client Billing (`/clients/:clientId/billing`) for per-client financials, and Matter Billing (`/matters/:matterId/billing`) for per-case details including time entries.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Authentication:** Multi-user authentication is handled via Replit Auth, supporting various providers (Google, GitHub, Apple, email).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A three-tier role system (admin, member, viewer) is implemented, granting route-level permissions. The first registered user becomes an admin, with subsequent users defaulting to "member."
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for relational data, and an in-memory store (MemStorage) for non-authentication related temporary data. Sessions are managed using connect-pg-simple in PostgreSQL.
- **API Design:** A RESTful JSON API with a modular route architecture using Express.
- **Cloudflare Security Hardening:** Comprehensive security layer designed for Cloudflare + Replit deployment. Features: 40+ scanner tripwire traps (blocks /wp-admin, /.env, /.git, /phpmyadmin, etc.), Cloudflare Turnstile server-side verification on public form submissions (requires TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY and TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY env vars), dedicated form rate limiters (10/10min for forms, 5/10min for contact), trust proxy enabled for Cloudflare IP forwarding, custom domain CORS support (via APP_DOMAIN env var), and CSP directives updated for Turnstile widget. Security telemetry via /api/security/threat-summary endpoint with IP analytics, scanned path tracking, and Cloudflare integration status. Security Dashboard "Threat Intel" tab shows real-time threat intelligence. Scanner traps and rate limits log to security_events table for analysis.
